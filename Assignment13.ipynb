    "The purpose of this assignment is to: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Learn how to perform webscraping (extracting content from a webpage in order to analyze the text) using the `BeautifulSoup` library \n",
    "\n",
    "* Use the `Textatistic` library to generate a readability score using the Dale-Chall score \n",
    "\n",
    "* Report the sentiment polarity and subjectivity using TextBlob \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:**  We really should clean up the scraped text more -- if you print what is returned from the BeautifulSoup library, \n",
    "you will see that there is a bunch of other junk in there, which is likely messing up the readability score and the polarity. For example, I loaded a first-grade reading level book located here:  http://www.funbrainjr.com/stories/BrainyBlueberryAndTheBackpackBalloon/ \n",
    "and the Textatistic library reported a grade level of 13 (Freshman in college!).   Most likely, if we removed more of the \"junk\" from the webpage and just focused on the text, it would work better.  Data Munging is a critical part of any analysis! \n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment, three websites have been selected, for articles on the same event by three different U.S. reporting agencies: \n",
    "\n",
    "* https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/04/07/us/ketanji-brown-jackson-vote-scotus\n",
    "\n",
    "* https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ketanji-brown-jackson-supreme-court-senate-confirmation-first-black-woman/    \n",
    "\n",
    "* https://www.foxnews.com/politics/senate-confirmation-vote-ketanji-brown-jackson-supreme-court  \n",
    "\n",
    "We will write a python program to connect to these websites, download the text by webscraping, do some basic data munging, and then perform some analysis.  As we will see, we’ll encounter a few issues – but these are very common and it’s important to see how complex a task like this can be to get really accurate answers.  Be sure to read the Discussion section below to see what these issues are. \n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment is a great place to use good programming practice – and to break repeated tasks into functions.  Main will be provided, and you will write several functions that each perform a task.   \n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Function 1: extract_text(addr)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function that takes a web address, connects to the website using the requests package, extracts the text using the BeautifulSoup package, and performs some basic data munging to remove HTML tags, and then returns the cleaned text. We often call this action webscraping, since we are quickly “scraping off” the text from a webpage. \n",
