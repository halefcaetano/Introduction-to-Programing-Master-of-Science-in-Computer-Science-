    "In this assignment, you will use the requests package and your understanding of JSON objects to build a very basic web browser in just a few lines of code.  We’ll limit it to connection only to Wikipedia – and only display limited information.  The user will be able to type in the exact Wikipedia article (for example, “Ball_State_University”).  Your program will connect to Wikipedia API, retrieve the JSON object, split out the information of interest, and print it to the screen. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### You should carefully study the following the Live Coding lectures: \n",
    "\n",
    "* “Using python to connect to an API: the requests package” shows how to use the requests package to connect to Wikipedia and retrieve a JSON object for an article. \n",
    "\n",
    "* “Exploring JSON structure” shows how to access complex internal JSON structures to extract the desired information, using an example JSON object. \n",
    "\n",
    "* You’ll need to use the techniques from the second Live Coding lecture to extract the information that you need from the Wikipedia JSON that is retrieved using the techniques for the first lecture. \n",
    "\n",
    "The function definitions for this lab are relatively general – and structured more like something you’d want to write for yourself, instead of an assignment.  However, we still need to make it gradable, so that you can have the instant feedback that is so important for learning – so we’ll define the function names, arguments, and return values for that purpose. \n",
    "\n",
    "- #### Function 1: get_Wikipedia_json_for_title(article_title) \n",
    "Write a function that will connect to Wikipedia and request an article of a specific title (passed to the function as a string). The function will return the JSON object received. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- #### Function 2: json_title_and_toc(json_obj) \n",
    "Write a function that will accept a JSON object, and return a string that contains relevant information about the article sections.  The returned information must match the format shown below.  Each section will be returned as a line in the string, formatted exactly in this manner: \n",
    "\n",
    "    - *Section#: Title of section*\n",
    "\n",
    "    - In the returned string, the # sign indicates the section number as stored in the JSON object, with no space between the word “Section” and the number. \n",
    "\n",
    "        - Is this totally arbitrary that I specify it this way?  Yes!  Does it help illustrate the point that when we work with data and write programs, we often must get something exactly correct in order for it to work?  Absolutely.  Very frequently, we encounter weird formatting requirements, and one character of a difference can cause the whole program to fail.  (In this case, it will not pass the grading requirements!) \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Main program \n",
    "\n",
    "As usual, main() is provided.  In this case, though, there is an annoying issue that should probably be fixed (but is optional!).  If you are up for a challenge, make it so that your program will NOT crash if you enter a title for an article that does not exist in Wikipedia (such as the article “asoidfjklwqer;ewqm”). \n",
