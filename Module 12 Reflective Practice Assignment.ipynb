This does not mean you'll get a bad grade for this assignment -- failing is a necessary part of learning, though none of us particularly enjoy it.  Sometimes what you'll try to accomplish is just too big of a task for a Reflective Practice session, and that is ok -- you will still have learned from the experience."

    "The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. The ruling comes out of James' lawsuit, in which she alleged Trump \"inflated his net worth by billions of dollars\" and said his children helped him to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "When Trump was president, James sued his administration dozens of times, challenging policies on the environment, immigration, education, health care and other issues.Trump sued James in November and claimed she abused her position as attorney general to \"recklessly injure\" him, his family and his businesses.  Trump alleged James was pursuing \"a relentless, pernicious, public, and unapologetic crusade\" against him \"with the stated goal of destroying him personally, financially, and politically.\"In January, Trump voluntarily dismissed that lawsuit.Trump was deposed as part of the lawsuit in April for the second time. During that deposition, the former president and 2024 GOP frontrunner, answered questions. The first deposition took place in August, but Trump invoked his Fifth Amendment rights.Trump has denied any wrongdoing and has said the investigation is politically motivated and a \"witch hunt.\" '''\n",

    "According to the ruling, which allows the civil trial to begin next week, Trump lied to banks and insurers by both overvaluing and undervaluing his assets when it was to his benefit, while at the same time exaggerating his net worth to the tune of billions of dollars.\n",
    "\n",
    "In his 35-page ruling, Judge Arthur Engoron said Trump continually lied on his financial statements and was able to get favorable loan terms and lower insurance premiums as a result. Trump's legal arguments defending the statements are based in \"a fantasy world, not the real world,\" Engoron wrote.\n",
    "\n",
    "The judge went on to say that the case was essentially a \"documents case,\" and \"the documents here clearly contain fraudulent valuations that defendants used in business, satisfying [the attorney general's] burden to establish liability as a matter of law against defendants. Defendants’ respond that: the documents do not say what they say; that there is no such thing as 'objective; value; and that, essentially, the Court should not believe its own eyes.\"\n",
